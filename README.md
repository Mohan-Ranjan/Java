Cruise Ship Boarding System

Overview

This project implements a Cruise Ship Boarding System in Java, where passengers are assigned to cabins on a cruise ship. 
The program allows users to interact with a menu system to manage cabin assignments, track passengers, and handle various operations like adding, deleting, and viewing passengers, as well as sorting them alphabetically.

Features

Task 1 (Arrays Solution):
Manage 12 cabins using an array to assign and view passengers.
Operations: Add customer, view cabins, delete customer, find cabin by customer, display empty cabins, store/load data, and order passengers alphabetically.

Task 2 (Classes Solution):
Implement Cabin and Passenger classes.
Each cabin holds up to 3 passengers with details such as name and expenses.
Additional functionality to display passengers' expenses and total expenses.

Task 3 (Queue Implementation):
Add a Waiting List Queue (circular queue) for passengers when cabins are full.
Automatically move the next customer in the waiting list to an available cabin when one is deleted.

Task 4 (Testing):
Comprehensive testing of all functionalities with test cases and expected results.
Evaluation of the array-based and class-based solutions.
